This is a project of Alex Kovalchuk and Dina Svetlitsky from Ben-Gurion University, Israel.
It was part of a Robotics course by Prof. Ronen Brafman.

In this project we used ROS to program a Komodo robot with elevator by RoboTiCan.
The robot detects a red ball placed on a bench, assuming no obstacles between the robot an the ball. 
It approaches the ball and lifts it with its arm.
